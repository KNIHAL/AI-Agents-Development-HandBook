## 🧠 What’s an AI Agent?

An **AI agent** is basically any system that can *sense* its environment, *think*, and then *act* based on that info. It’s like a smart software robot that tries to do its job automatically.

The basic cycle:
> **Perceive → Decide → Act**

## 🪜 Prerequisites for AI Agents

Before building or understanding agents, you should know:
- **Programming basics** (Python is common)
- **Logic and algorithms**
- **Data structures**
- **Understanding of environment modeling**
- **Some AI concepts** (machine learning, search strategies, etc.)

## 🧩 Types of AI Agents

Let’s check out the main flavors:

### 1. ⚡ Reactive Agents

**They react instantly. No thinking, no memory.**

- **Example**: Simple bots in games that just dodge attacks.
- **Pros**: Fast and simple
- **Cons**: Can’t plan or learn

```text
IF obstacle → TURN right
No analysis, just action.
```

### 2. 🧠 Deliberative Agents
They think before acting. Got a brain and a plan.

Use models of the world to make decisions.

- Example: A delivery drone that maps out the best path.
- Pros: More intelligent behavior
- Cons: Slower and more complex

They’re like the nerdy planners—don’t rush, think first.

### 3. 📚 Learning Agents
They evolve over time. Learn from experience.

Use feedback to improve decisions.

- Example: A recommendation system improving results as you click.
- Pros: Adaptive, smarter over time
- Cons: Need training, can mislearn
- Subtypes include:
    - Supervised learners
    - Reinforcement learners

These agents basically “level up” like game characters.

### 📌 Summary Cheat Sheet

- Reactive → Fast, no memory
- Deliberative → Think, plan, act
- Learning → Adapt, grow smarter

All agents need sensors + actuators + decision logic
