# üìÑ Document Loaders

Document Loaders in Flowise let your agents **ingest and process data from external sources** like PDFs, websites, Notion pages, and more.

These nodes are the first step for building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), summarizers, Q&A bots, and any agent that needs real data to work with.

## üóÉÔ∏è What Do Document Loaders Do?

They take **unstructured content** from a file, web page, or service, and return it as **clean text** chunks your LLM can understand.

Example formats supported:
- PDF
- DOCX / Word files
- Markdown
- Notion pages
- Web articles
